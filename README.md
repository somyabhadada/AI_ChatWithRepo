# ChatWithRepo ü§ñ

ChatWithRepo is an AI-powered GitHub code assistant that allows you to interactively chat with any GitHub repository. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), vector embeddings, and knowledge graph technologies, it enables you to ask questions about a repo‚Äôs structure, logic, dependencies, and even suggest or generate code changes.

---

## Features

- **Chat with any GitHub repo:** Clone any public repository and interact with it in natural language.
- **Deep code understanding:** Uses code embeddings and knowledge graphs to understand functions, classes, and relations.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation:** Finds relevant code snippets and explanations using Chroma vector database and LLMs.
- **Conversational memory:** Keeps track of chat history so you can ask follow-up questions.
- **Code change suggestions:** Proposes code edits and explains dependencies between functions.
- **Graph analysis:** Extracts and queries code structure as a knowledge graph (Neo4j).

## How It Works

1. **Clone a Repository:**  
   Enter a GitHub repo URL‚Äîthe app clones it locally for analysis.

2. **Build the Knowledge Base:**  
   - Parses Python files, extracting functions, classes, calls, and imports.
   - Stores relationships in a JSON file and in Neo4j as a knowledge graph.
   - Documents are embedded via HuggingFace models and indexed for semantic search.

3. **Chat Interface:**  
   - Ask anything about the repo (‚ÄúHow does authentication work?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is function X used?‚Äù).
   - The app retrieves code context, summarizes, and generates detailed answers and suggestions.

4. **Edit Suggestions:**  
   - For implementation/change questions, the bot proposes code edits and affected functions.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/somyabhadada/AI_ChatWithRepo.git
   cd AI_ChatWithRepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Python 3.8+
   - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
   - [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)
   - [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/)
   - [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/)
   - [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
   - Other requirements in `requirements.txt` (add this file if missing)
   - git lfs install
   - git clone https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-code-v1

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in any API keys if using LLM APIs.
   - Make sure Neo4j is running and accessible if using the graph features.

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Interact**
   - Enter a GitHub repo URL when prompted.
   - Ask questions about the codebase or request code changes in the chat.

## Example Prompts

- ‚ÄúExplain the role of `auth.py` in this repo.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhere is the function `process_data` called?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSuggest a change to improve error handling in `main.py`.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúShow the class hierarchy.‚Äù
